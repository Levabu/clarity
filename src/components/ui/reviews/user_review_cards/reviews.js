    title: "Technically a $45 annual fee card",
    content:
      "The preferred is 'technically' a $45 annual fee card, because you get a $50 hotel credit every year. So as long as you stay in a hotel once per year that you book through ultimate rewards... you get that $50.",

    title: "Great intro travel card with perks",
    content:
      "The CSP is a great intro travel card with good travel partners and a low AF relative to more frequent flyer travel cards. Transfer points vs. booking through the travel portal. Also, to offset the AF, you do have the $50 hotel credit (when booking hotels through their travel portal,) and I have been able to take advantage of the quarterly instacart credit of $15. This is also a no foreign transaction fee card so you could take it with you on your international travels.",

    title: "Worth it for initial bonus and travel booking",
    content:
      "This card is worth it if you qualify for the initial bonus and you're comfortable using your points to book travel through the card's issuer. It doesn't matter which airline or hotel you use. As long as you book through the issuer's portal, you'll get the best rewards rate. There are plenty of other good cards without foreign fees to choose from if you're still on the fence.",

    title: "Questioning the value over regular Chase cards",
    content:
      "What is the advantage of the Sapphire Preferred over the regular Chase cards? The Unlimited 1.5% and Flex both have the same Chase Travel 5%, 3% dining. So I'm struggling for the 'worth' of the sapphire and it's 1% on everyday purchases. Mainly access to using points with travel partners? No foreign trans fees? 2% 'any other travel'? Are there more/better travel protections than the other Chase cards?",

    title: "Worth it for SUB, but consider alternatives",
    content:
      "If you are willing to reapply every 4 years for the sub then it's worth it. Even the standard sub gives you 60000, which is worth at least $600. Annual fee for 4 years is only $380. Not to mention I did not count the $50 hotel credit. However, if you just looking for a no foreign transaction fee card. Bilt and C1 Savor one are both really good cards where Bilt has transfer partners and Savor one gives you 3% back on dining and grocery. Savor one also gives you free uber one until sometime next year and 10% back on uber in the states.",

    title: "Excellent for travel point optimization",
    content:
      "The Chase Sapphire Preferred is a game-changer for travel enthusiasts. The ability to transfer points to various airline and hotel partners at a 1:1 ratio is invaluable. I've managed to get outsized value by strategically transferring points for business class flights. The travel protections are also top-notch, saving me thousands when a trip was cancelled due to weather.",

    title: "Great for dining and travel combo",
    content:
      "As someone who loves both dining out and traveling, this card has been a perfect fit. The 3x points on dining and 2x on travel add up quickly. I particularly appreciate the broad definition of 'travel' which includes rideshares and parking. The Pay Yourself Back feature has also been useful for getting good value on non-travel redemptions. Just wish the everyday spend rate was a bit higher.",
